## Overview  
This project is an AI/ML-based image classification system that identifies and classifies sport celebrities from a given dataset. The system uses cutting-edge techniques such as **OpenCV** for image processing, **wavelet transformation** for feature extraction, and **grid search** for hyperparameter tuning. The trained model is saved as a **pickle file** for easy deployment and reuse.
